FIXES/BUGS

- the test 'racetest -kT toctou' does not produce or find any races


===============================================================================
LOGIC/ALGORITMS

- exit-exit-wait: consider 1 forks 2 forks 3 forks 4, then 2,3,4 exit,
  and collected in that order by 1. the crosscut for the 1-2-4 race is
  1 pre-wait, 2,4 pre-exit, and 3 post fork. but then, 4 is not yet
  reparented to 1, so cannot be waited-for, so the race is skipped.
  => solve: add HB due to reparenting ?


===============================================================================
REFACTOR/REWRITE

- introduce class "mutator" to describe changes to the log file
 (bookmarks, injecst, etc)
